## Contributing
1. File an issue about what you're working on.
2. Fork the repository, develop and test your code changes, add docs.
3. Make sure that your commit messages clearly describe the changes.
4. Send a pull request.

## Fork the Repository
Be sure to add the relevant tests before making the pull request. Docs will be
updated after we merge to `master`, but you should also build the docs yourself and make sure they're readable.

## Make the Pull Request
Once you have made all your changes, tests, and updated the documentation, make a pull request to move everything back into the main branch of the `repository`. Be sure to reference the original issue in the pull request.
